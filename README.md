# Impossible-Pacman
Implementation of the classic game of pacman plus the application of AI with Floyd Warshall algorithm for shortest path

# How to run it
1. Download the latest version of Cmake stable (Last Release from the official site)

https://cmake.org/download/

2. Source folder: where are the code sources (.cpp and .h). Destination folder: where you want the project to be created

3. Configure (if it doesn't find QtMultimedia and QtWidgest, add them manually by clicking on the 3 dots to the right of the red error bar and searching for them in the Mac search bar)

N.B. The Qt library needs to be installed on the machine, otherwise it doesn't know where to get it

4. Generate

N.B. After doing Generate, both the sources and the destination must NOT change path in the folders and you must NOT change the names of the folders or the project, otherwise nothing works anymore

5. In the destination folder click on the project created with the chosen IDE (for Xcode: at the top choose the impossiblepacman exec, click on the Xcode Play)
